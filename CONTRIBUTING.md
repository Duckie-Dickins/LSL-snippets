"LSL (Linden Scripting Language) is the scripting language that gives behavior to Second Life primitives, objects, and avatars. This is a community effort to provide an accurate & open documentation resource on LSL for scripters of all skill levels."

Pull requests are always welcomed, same as reporting issues with the LSL experiments here (inworld, via GitHub, e-mail or Discord). ~

This repository will not host anything that is even remotely harmful to the Second Life community.
